All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.  

* Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
* Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
* Sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## Support open source and earn a limited edition T-shirt!
### Rules
To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone).
PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled **Hacktoberfest**.
If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
