Wilson's theorem states that if p is a prime number, then (p-1)! % p = p-1.
This equation is always true for prime numbers and never true for composite numbers. 
Using Wilson's theorem, this program displays all the prime numbers that are present in an user specified range (inclusive) are displayed.
